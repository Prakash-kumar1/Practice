<!-- Question no:-1  what is difference between async and defer?? -->
<!-- Answer :-  Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. 
                Defer means your  script will only execute after the page has finished loading.-->

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Dom traversing</title>
        <script src="./traverse.js" defer></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>My heading</h1>
            <p>Some useful information</p>
        </div>
    </body>
